# Full Stack Development Course - Module 3 Code Examples

## Overview

This repository contains code examples for all the topics covered in Module 3 of the Full Stack Development course. These examples are designed to help students who are more code-based learners, like myself, to better understand the concepts by seeing them in action. Each example provides a practical implementation of the topics discussed in the module, giving students a clear understanding of what each topic should look like in code.

## Topics Covered

1. **Array Methods**
   - Examples of common array methods such as `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more.

2. **Arrow Functions**
   - Explanation and examples of arrow functions, including their syntax and unique properties.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Concepts of OOP including classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

4. **Objects and Classes**

## How to Use

Each topic is covered in a separate file with detailed comments explaining the code. You can browse through the files to find the topic you're interested in and study the examples provided. These examples are meant to be run in a JavaScript environment, so feel free to copy the code and experiment with it on your own.

## Conclusion

These code examples are intended to supplement the theoretical knowledge provided in the course by giving you practical, hands-on experience with each topic. By working through these examples, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to apply the concepts you've learned in real-world scenarios.

Happy coding!
